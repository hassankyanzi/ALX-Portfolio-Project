## Executive Summary

Our proposal outlines the development and implementation of a Field Team Productivity and Tracking Solution for businesses that rely heavily on field sales and installation teams. The proposed solution will provide comprehensive tools to monitor and manage field team activities, ensuring efficient sales and installation processes.

## Background

The client's business relies on field sales and installation teams and call centers that generate leads for potential customers. However, they lack a comprehensive tool to monitor and manage the activities of their field team members.

## Problem Statement

The lack of visibility into field team activities hinders the client's ability to optimize productivity, ensure timely follow-ups, and track the team's movements during the day. This has led to inefficiencies and lost revenue.

## Technologies

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin
- **Frameworks:** React, React Native, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Libraries:** Redux, Axios, Moment.js, Leaflet
- **Platforms:** AWS, Heroku
- **Hardware:** Development machines, Mobile devices
- **Books and Resources:** Stack Overflow, GitHub, various technical books

## Infrastructure

### Branching and Merging Process

For this project, we will adopt the Git Flow branching model for our version control system. The Git Flow model provides a consistent and organized approach to branching and merging, which is particularly useful for team collaboration.

Under Git Flow, we will maintain two primary branches: `master` and `develop`. The `master` branch will always reflect the production-ready state of the application, while the `develop` branch will contain the latest development changes.

When a new feature or bug fix is required, a new branch will be created from the `develop` branch, with a descriptive name that reflects the feature or bug. The developer will then work on this branch, making commits as necessary, until the feature or bug fix is complete.

Once the changes are complete and tested, the feature branch will be merged back into the `develop` branch. After a comprehensive testing phase, the `develop` branch will be merged into the `master` branch, and the production environment will be updated with the latest changes.

We will also utilize pull requests to review and approve changes before merging them into the `develop` branch. This process will ensure that changes are thoroughly reviewed, tested, and documented before they are released to production.

### Deployment Strategy

- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and user acceptance testing
- **Staging Environment:** Final testing before deployment
- **Deployment Plan:** Detailed steps for deployment
- **Rollout Strategy:** Phased deployment starting with a small group of users
- **Monitoring:** Post-deployment monitoring
- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups

## Data Population

- Import data from CSV files
- Integrate with existing data sources
- Use data generation tools for test data

## Objectives

- Monitor field team activities in real-time
- Track team movements and locations
- Ensure timely follow-ups with potential customers
- Improve overall sales and installation efficiency

## Proposed Solution

A mobile and web-based application with features such as GPS tracking, route planning, task management, customer information storage, reporting, and integration with existing systems.

## Risks

### Technical Risks

1. **Integration Risks:** The project involves integrating with various third-party systems, including CRM and call center software. There is a risk that the integration may not work as expected, resulting in data inconsistencies and delays. To mitigate this risk, the development team will perform extensive testing and work closely with the third-party providers to ensure seamless data exchange.
   
2. **Security Risks:** The project involves handling sensitive customer data, and there is a risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. The team will implement security measures such as encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to prevent any security breaches.

### Non-technical Risks

1. **Organizational Resistance:** The implementation of the field team productivity and tracking solution may face resistance from some employees who may view it as intrusive or unnecessary. To mitigate this risk, the team will conduct extensive training and engage with the employees to help them understand the benefits of the system.

2. **User Adoption:** The success of the project is heavily dependent on user adoption. If the field team members do not adopt the system, it will not deliver the intended benefits. To mitigate this risk, the team will involve the end-users in the design and testing process, ensuring that the system meets their needs and is easy to use.

## Expected Outcomes

- Increased field team efficiency and productivity
- Improved route planning and resource allocation
- Enhanced communication and collaboration
- Better visibility and control over field team activities

## Project Timeline

- **Phase 1:** Requirements gathering and analysis - 2 weeks
- **Phase 2:** Development and testing - 10 weeks
- **Phase 3:** Deployment and user acceptance testing - 2 weeks
- **Phase 4:** Post-deployment support and maintenance - ongoing

## Budget

The proposed budget for the project is $200,000, including development, testing, deployment, and post-deployment support and maintenance.

## Conclusion

The FieldTrack Pro solution will provide the necessary tools to optimize sales and installation processes, ensuring higher efficiency and accountability.
